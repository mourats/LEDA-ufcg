/**
 * This algorithm applies two selection sorts simultaneously. In a same
 * iteration, a selection sort pushes the greatest elements to the right and
 * another selection sort pushes the smallest elements to the left. At the end
 * of the first iteration, the smallest element is in the first position (index
 * 0) and the greatest element is the last position (index N-1). The next
 * iteration does the same from index 1 to index N-2. And so on. The execution
 * continues until the array is completely ordered.
